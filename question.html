    <h3 style=" text-align: center;">The Difference Between Map,Filter,forEach and Find?</h3>
    <h2>
        <P style="color: lawngreen;">ANS :</P>

        map, filter, forEach, and find are all array methods in JavaScript that operate on arrays and return a new array
        or a single value. The main differences between them are: <br><br>

        1.<span style="background-color: red; color: white;">map</span>: returns a new array with the same length as the
        original
        array, where each element is the result of
        applying a callback function to the corresponding element in the original array.
        <br><br>

        2.<span style="background-color: red; color: white;">filter</span>: returns a new array containing all elements
        of the original array that satisfy a certain condition
        defined by a callback function.
        <br><br>

        3.<span style="background-color: red; color: white;">forEach</span>: calls a callback function for each element
        in the array, but does not return a new array.
        <br><br>

        4.<span style="background-color: red; color: white;">find</span>: returns the first element in the array
        that satisfies a certain condition defined by a callback
        function, or undefined if no such element is found.

    <h3 style=" text-align: center;">What Is The Difference Between Local Storage , Session Storage And Cookies?</h3>
    <h2>
        <p style="color: lawngreen;">ANS :</P>

        1. <span style="background-color: red; color: white;">Local Storage</span>:
        Local storage is a client-side storage mechanism that allows web applications to store data on a user's device
        without any expiration date. The data is stored as key-value pairs, and can only be accessed by scripts on the
        same domain. Local storage has a much larger storage capacity than cookies, with most browsers supporting up to
        10MB of data.
        <br><br>
        2.<span style="background-color: red; color: white;">Session Storage</span>:
        Session storage is similar to local storage, but the data is cleared once the user closes the browser window. It
        is useful for storing data that needs to be accessed during a user's session on a website, but does not need to
        persist beyond that session. Like local storage, session storage has a larger storage capacity than cookies,
        with most browsers supporting up to 10MB of data.

        In summary, cookies are used to store small amounts of data with a defined expiration date, while local storage
        and session storage provide larger storage capacity and do not have expiration dates (or have one tied to a
        session). Local storage is meant for long-term storage while session storage is useful for short-term storage
        within a session.
        <br><br>
        3. <span style="background-color: red; color: white;">Cookies</span>:
        Cookies are small text files that are created by a website and stored on the user's device. They are used to
        store user preferences, login information, and other data that can be accessed by both the client-side and
        server-side scripts. Cookies have a lifespan, which is determined by the expiration date set by the website.
        They can be set to either be persistent (which means that they will remain on the user's device even after they
        close the browser) or session-based (which means that they will be deleted once the browser is closed). Cookies
        have a limited storage capacity of 4KB. <br><br>
        In summary, cookies are used to store small amounts of data with a defined expiration date, while local storage
        and session storage provide larger storage capacity and do not have expiration dates (or have one tied to a
        session). Local storage is meant for long-term storage while session storage is useful for short-term storage
        within a session.

    <h3 style=" text-align: center;">What Is Event Loop? How Does It Work?</h3>
    <h2>
        <p style="color: lawngreen;">ANS :</P>

        The event loop is a fundamental part of JavaScript's concurrency model, and it's responsible for managing the
        execution of asynchronous tasks in a single-threaded environment.The event loop has two main components: the
        call stack and the task queue. The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the execution context of
        the currently executing code. When a function is called, its execution context is pushed onto the call stack,
        and when it returns, its context is popped off the stack.By using the event loop, JavaScript can handle multiple
        asynchronous tasks concurrently without blocking the execution of other code. It allows developers to write
        non-blocking code that is efficient and scalable. However, it's important to understand how the event loop works
        to avoid common pitfalls, such as blocking the event loop with long-running tasks or creating infinite loops.
        <br>
        <P style="text-align: center;">Example of Event Loop : <br><br>

            console.log('start'); <br>

            setTimeout(() => {
            console.log('setTimeout');
            }, 0);<br>

            Promise.resolve().then(() => {
            console.log('promise');<br>
            });<br>

            console.log('end');<br>

    <h3 style=" text-align: center;">What Is QuizTimer?</h3>
    <h2>
        <p style="color: lawngreen;">ANS :</P>

        <span style="background-color: red; color: white;">quizTimer </span> is not a built-in feature or function
        in JavaScript, but it could refer to a variable or function that is used to implement a timer in a quiz
        application.

        In a quiz application, a timer could be used to limit the amount of time a user has to answer each question.
        The timer could be displayed on the screen, and when it reaches zero, the user's answer is automatically
        submitted, and the next question is displayed.

    <h4 style=" text-align: center;">Question Number 5</h4>

    <h3 style=" text-align: center;">What is the way to use ChooseQuiz?</h3>
    <h2>
        <p style="color: lawngreen;">ANS :</P>

        Without seeing the code or context in which the choosequiz function is used, it's difficult to say exactly what
        its purpose is. However, I can provide some general information about functions and their potential use cases in
        a quiz application.In a quiz application, the choosequiz function could be used to allow the user to select a
        quiz from a list of available quizzes. The function might display a menu of quiz options and wait for the user
        to make a selection. Once the user has made a selection, the function could return the ID or name of the chosen
        quiz to the main program, which would then load the corresponding questions and begin the quiz.
